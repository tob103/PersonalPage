    <h2> About Me</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="aboutmetext">
    <p class="aboutme"> I’m a <span class="pro"> progammer </span> that was born in Nashville, TN. I love learning new things and taking on new projects. This project right now was my first personal page made from scratch. I wanted to design
      something simple that I can work on as I get better at web design. </p>

    <h2> Hobbies</h2>
    <p> Although I’m a programmer, I actually have other hobbies besides coding <img src="https://emojipedia-us.s3.dualstack.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/thumbs/120/apple/237/grinning-face_1f600.png" class="smiley">. I’m an avid sports fan. I love
      watching the following sports:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Basketball </li>
      <li> Football </li>
      <li> Soccer </li>
      <li> Track and Field </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Some of my other hobbies include <span class ="pro"> reading, watching movies, hanging out, and trying new things.</span> I love the random exciting things that can happen once you decide to try something new. For example, I would have never known that escape rooms can be so much fun until I tried them. </p>
